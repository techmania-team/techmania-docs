TECHMANIA supports various modifiers that allow you to customize the gameplay experience. When selecting a pattern, click the "Modifiers" button to view and select modifiers. This page explains the available modifiers.

# Note opacity

**Fade out**: notes start fading out when the scanline is 1/2 scans away, and completely disappear when the scanline is 1/4 scans away.

**Fade out 2**: notes start fading out when the scanline is 1 scan away, and completely disappear when the scanline is 1/2 scans away.

**Fade in**: notes remain invisible until the scanline is 1/2 scans away, then they start fading in, and become fully visible when the scanline is 1/4 scans away.

**Fade in 2**: notes remain invisible until the scanline is 1/4 scans away, then they start fading in, and become fully visible when the scanline is 1/8 scans away.

# Scanline opacity

**Blink**: scanlines remain invisible and only briefly appear every 1/4 scans.

**Blink 2**: scanlines remain invisible and only briefly appear every 1/2 scans.

**Blind**: scanlines remain invisible.

# Scan direction

Determines the scan direction of top and bottom scans, respectively. The default direction is right - left.

# Note position

**Mirror**: swaps lane 0 and lane 3, lane 1 and lane 2. In other words, vertically flips the entire pattern.

# Scan position

**Swap**: swaps top and bottom scans.

# Fever

**Fever off**: Fever becomes completely disabled.

**Auto Fever**: automatically activates Fever whenever the Fever bar is filled. This simplifies gameplay, but the player also loses the ability to choose when to activate Fever, therefore we do not consider this cheating.

# Keysound

**Auto keysound**: plays each note's keysound automatically at its correct time, disregarding player input. Player input makes no sound.

# Assist tick

**Assist tick**: plays assist ticks (in addition to keysounds, if applicable) when the player plays notes.

**Auto assist tick**: plays assist ticks automatically at each note's correct time.

In either case, the tick sound is considered an SFX in audio options.

# Sudden death

**Sudden death**: instant fail on MISS or BREAK.

# Mode

Selecting any option other than "Normal" will invalidate your score.

**No fail**: the game does not end even when the player loses all HP.

**Auto play**: have the game play itself automatically. All player input is disregarded. Fever is deactivated.

**Practice**: more details later.

On the select pattern screen, you can hold Ctrl and click "Play" to set mode to no fail, or hold Shift and click "Play" to set mode to auto play.

# Control override

Selecting any option other than "None" will invalidate your score.

**Override to Touch/Keys/KM**: disregards the selected pattern's intended control scheme and uses the override scheme instead. Please note that patterns may not be fully playable when not using the intended control scheme.

# Scroll speed

Selecting "Half speed" will invalidate your score.

**Half speed**: doubles the selected pattern's BPS, effectively decreasing the scroll speed by half.

**Shifted half speed**: doubles the selected pattern's BPS, then shifts the entire pattern by half a scan. In some cases this produces a more musically "correct" grouping of scans.

# Practice mode

Practice mode allows you to jump back and forth between scans, pick a section in the pattern and loop over it, as well as change the game's speed. In practice mode, HP, score and Fever are disabled. Additionally, the loop function means the game will never end on its own. You can quit the game from the pause menu.

Please note that practice mode is unavailable in setlists.

The following controls are available:

![An image showing the available controls in practice mode](https://imgur.com/DY41TW6.png)

1. Jump to the previous scan
2. Shows the current scan number
3. Jump to the next scan

There may be a few negative scans before scan #0 to leave time for the BGA and/or backing track to start.

4. Set the loop's start point at the current scan
5. Shows the current loop
6. Set the loop's end point at the current scan
7. Reset the loop to cover the entire pattern

When the game reaches 1 scan after the end point, it will automatically jump to the start point.

8. Decrease game speed by 0.05x
9. Shows the current speed
10. Increase game speed by 0.05x

Available speeds range from 0.5x to 2x.

There are also toggles for auto play and hitbox visibility. For keyboard shortcuts, refer to the text under / next to each control.
