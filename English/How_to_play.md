TECHMANIA supports 3 different control schemes. When selecting a pattern, the icon to the left of its name tells you which control scheme to use.

The Touch control scheme requires a touchscreen. You can test your touchscreen from the options menu. It is also recommended that you go to system settings and turn off visual feedback for touches, as they may cause the game to lag. On Windows 10, this option can be found in Settings - Ease of Access - Mouse pointer - Change touch feedback.

The Keys control scheme uses these 4 rows of keys on your keyboard. Each row corresponds to one of four lanes on the screen. To play a note in a certain lane, press any key in the corresponding row.

Different from the Keys control scheme, here you can press any key in any row to play the keyboard notes, wherever they are.
